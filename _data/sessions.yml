  description: "Authors: Bernard Silverman<br/>
  <p>Abstract:  It is only in recent decades that the crime of Modern Slavery/Human Trafficking has become well established in the political and public consciousness.  I will discuss the part that statistical approaches have played and the actual and potential contribution of machine learning.   One important issue is the right way to deal with estimates that are known to be inaccurate but nevertheless may have beneficial impact.   There are some analogies with the public health achievements of Florence Nightingale in the 19th century, which saved many millions of lives even before the advent of modern scientific medicine.   </p>"

  description: "Authors: Caio Almeida, Gustavo Freire, René Garcia and Rodrigo Hizmeri<br/>
  <p>Abstract:  We combine high-frequency stock returns with risk-neutralization to extract the daily common component of tail risks perceived by investors in the cross-section of firms. Our tail risk measure significantly predicts the equity premium and variance risk premium at short-horizons. Furthermore, a long-short portfolio built by sorting stocks on their recent exposure to tail risk generates abnormal returns with respect to standard factor models and helps explain the momentum anomaly. Incorporating investors' preferences via risk-neutralization is fundamental to our findings. </p>"

  title: "Finetuning NLP models for financial forecasting. Do or Don't? A Cryptocurrency Return Prediction Case Study"
  description: "Authors: Vincent Gurgul and Duygu Ider and Stefan Lessmann<br/>
  <p>Abstract:  Anticipating price developments in financial markets is a topic of continued interest in forecasting.
  Funneled by advancements in deep learning and natural language processing (NLP) together with the availability of
  vast amounts of textual data in form of news articles, social media postings, etc., an increasing number of studies
  incorporate text-based predictors in forecasting models. The hypothesis that text-based cues carry predictive information
  appears especially plausible for cryptocurrency markets, which are the subject of this study.  Noting some variation in
  how specifically prior work employs text features and advanced pre-trained NLP models for price modeling, the first research
  goal is to survey available options and systematically compare selected approaches. For example, many studies convert raw
  text into sentiment signals and use these as auxiliary inputs in a financial forecasting model. Concentrating on sentiment
  and, thereby, disregarding the actual content of the text, one may ask whether the sentiment extraction approach is suitable.
  In this context, we emphasize weak labeling, an NLP approach to finetune text classifiers on an unlabeled target corpus,
  which holds potential for financial forecasting but has received little attention in the corresponding literature. A second
  research goal concerns the well-known curse of dimensionality. Combining fundamental, technical, and text-based features in a
  forecasting model increases dimensionality substantially. This challenge is amplified in cryptocurrency forecasting in that
  yet another set of potentially relevant features can be extracted from the blockchain. We examine the predictive value of the
  different feature groups and benchmark alternative forecasting methods for high-dimensional time series data. In this context,
  we emphasize the temporal fusion transformer, which promises automatic feature selection, and assess its effectiveness vis-a-vis
  benchmark forecasting models. In sum, our study contributes original empirical evidence to the literature on cryptocurrency price
  forecasting. We also introduce several advanced deep learning methodologies for text processing and time series forecasting to the
  financial market modeling community, which are generally applicable in the field and can benefit financial forecasting at large. </p>"

  title: "The Live Streaming Recommendation and Mutual Fund Performance"
  description: "Authors: Qingfu Liu (Fudan University), Zhidan Luo (Fudan University), Yang Song (Washington University) and Chuanjie Wang (Fudan University)<br/>
  <p>Abstract:  The live streaming economy, particularly live streaming e-commerce, is becoming a major component of China's
  digital economic development. This study investigates the impact of live streaming by fund companies on mutual fund performance,
  using data from over 10,000 live streams by 99 fund companies on China's leading fund live streaming platform, TianTian Fund APP.
  We employ machine learning techniques to process the live stream content and construct the 4Vs (Visual, Vocal, Verbal, and Visitor)
  to measure different aspects of the content. Our analysis reveals that participating in live streaming significantly increases
  investor attention and fund flow, but negatively affects performance. The 4Vs have heterogeneous effects on investor attention,
  fund flow, and performance. This research offers empirical evidence for the impact of live streaming on mutual fund performance
  and contributes to understanding the role of live streaming in the e-commerce industry.

  description: "Authors: Hoang Hai Tran, Julian Sester and Yijiong Zhang <br/>
  <p>Abstract: We study the optimal market making problem in order-driven electronic markets, with a focus on model uncertainty. We consider ambiguity in order arrival intensities and derive a robust strategy that can perform under various market conditions. To achieve this, we introduce a tractable model for the limit order book using Markov Decision Processes and develop robust Reinforcement Learning to solve the complex optimization problem. This approach enables us to accurately represent the order book dynamics with tick structures, as opposed to the usual price dynamics modeled in stochastic approaches.  </p>"

  title: "Neural Tangent Kernel in Implied Volatility Forecasting: A Nonlinear Functional Autoregression Approach"
  description: "Authors: Maria Grith, Ying Chen and Hannah L. H. Lai <br/>
  <p>Abstract:  Implied volatility (IV) remains a pivotal yet intricate component of financial markets, posing continuous
  challenges for accurate forecasting. We present a Nonlinear Functional Autoregression framework tailored to the series of
  implied volatility surfaces-a dynamic domain influenced by moneyness and maturity. This approach, designed for European put
   and call options, adeptly navigates the nonlinear and asymmetric temporal and spatial dependencies intrinsic to IV.
   Central to our approach is the functional Neural Tangent Kernel (fNTK) estimator. Grounded in the Neural Tangent Kernel
   parameterization, this estimator presents a modern statistical solution, parsing the intertwined dependencies found
   within the projections on the covariance operator of the IV surfaces' time series. A methodological contribution lies
   in establishing the nexus between fNTK and kernel regression, emphasizing fNTK's place in contemporary nonparametric
   statistical modelling. Transitioning from methodology to empirical evidence, we showcase the framework's real-world
   utility via an analysis of the S&P 500 index spanning January 2009 to December 2021. The fNTK not only stands out in
   forecasting accuracy, achieving an average improvement of 4.54% to 39.44% in RMSE forecast accuracy for 5 to 20-day-ahead
   forecasts but also paves the way for practical trading strategies. When underpinned by our model, straddle trading yields
   a remarkable Sharpe ratio between 3.72 and 5.41, culminating in a staggering 107.79% to 528.36% relative enhancement in
   trading results.  This convergence of methodological rigor and empirical results offers both a statistical advancement and a
   beacon for practitioners in the options market. </p>"

  description: "Authors: Alla Petukhina, Anastasija Tetereva<br/>
  <p>Abstract: This research extends the Machine Learning method Random Forest to perform portfolio
  optimization under the Markowitz framework. We will be considering a multi-asset portfolio composed
  by stocks, bonds, credits, high-yields, and commodities, while using macroeco- nomic and markets
  indicators to identify conditions under which the allocations are depend- ent on. The research demonstrates
  that the proposed methodology outperforms a classical Equal-Weight portfolio, as well as the plain Sharpe
  Ratio maximization and through the use of Hidden Markov Model for regime identification, even when taking
  into account trading costs. The results hold when shifting from an expanding window to a rolling window,
  and are further explored when considering restrains on turnover. We further make use of Accumulated
  Local Effects (ALE) plots in order to have insights on the black-box that drives the model and make inferences
  on how the asset classes perform under different macroeconomic and market conditions. </p>"

established tools for nonlinear regression modeling with numerous applications
in various fields. Their standard training is vulnerable with respect to the presence
of outliers in the data. We propose several novel (possibly regularized) versions,
which are based on robust loss functions inspired by robust linear regression.
Robust inter-quantile versions are also proposed. Intensive numerical experiments
reveal the robust versions to be meaningful for data contaminated by outliers.  </p>"

  title: "Explainable AI methods for early warning system of financial crises prediction"
  description: "Authors: Jurgita CerneviCiene and Audrius Kabasinskas<br/>
  <p>Abstract:  Financial crisis recognition and prediction become a considerable challenge
  for avoiding the bankruptcy of financial institutions and companies. The early warning methods
  of the financial crisis are an excellent tool for financial risk managers to reduce the likelihood
  of failures. The widespread use of Machine Learning (ML) in finance increased the need for
  Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) to improve interpretability and uncover hidden relationships
  between variables for financial decision-making while meeting regulatory requirements. Feature selection
  is crucial to reduce the number of variables in large datafederations while preserving important
  information as much as possible. In this study, we assess the possibility of an early warning
  technique for financial crisis detection by applying ML techniques to performance and risk measures
  of financial data from 2019-2022 period. Experimental findings indicate that some ML methods could
  be used to predict crises. Finally, we address concerns related to feature selection by analyzing
  LIME (Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations) values, a technique that has recently attracted
  increasing attention in XAI, to interpret the results of black-box methods. </p>"

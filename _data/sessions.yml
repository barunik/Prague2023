  title: "Statistics and Machine Learning in the fight against Modern Slavery"
  description: "Authors: Bernard Silverman<br/>
  <p>Abstract:  It is only in recent decades that the crime of Modern Slavery/Human Trafficking has become well established in the political and public consciousness.  I will discuss the part that statistical approaches have played and the actual and potential contribution of machine learning.   One important issue is the right way to deal with estimates that are known to be inaccurate but nevertheless may have beneficial impact.   There are some analogies with the public health achievements of Florence Nightingale in the 19th century, which saved many millions of lives even before the advent of modern scientific medicine.   </p>"

  title: "Tail Risk and Asset Prices in the Short-term"
  description: "Authors: Caio Almeida, Gustavo Freire, René Garcia and Rodrigo Hizmeri<br/>
  <p>Abstract:  We combine high-frequency stock returns with risk-neutralization to extract the daily common component of tail risks perceived by investors in the cross-section of firms. Our tail risk measure significantly predicts the equity premium and variance risk premium at short-horizons. Furthermore, a long-short portfolio built by sorting stocks on their recent exposure to tail risk generates abnormal returns with respect to standard factor models and helps explain the momentum anomaly. Incorporating investors' preferences via risk-neutralization is fundamental to our findings. </p>"

  title: "Finetuning NLP models for financial forecasting. Do or Don't? A Cryptocurrency Return Prediction Case Study"
  description: "Authors: Vincent Gurgul and Duygu Ider and Stefan Lessmann<br/>
  <p>Abstract:  Anticipating price developments in financial markets is a topic of continued interest in forecasting.
  Funneled by advancements in deep learning and natural language processing (NLP) together with the availability of
  vast amounts of textual data in form of news articles, social media postings, etc., an increasing number of studies
  incorporate text-based predictors in forecasting models. The hypothesis that text-based cues carry predictive information
  appears especially plausible for cryptocurrency markets, which are the subject of this study.  Noting some variation in
  how specifically prior work employs text features and advanced pre-trained NLP models for price modeling, the first research
  goal is to survey available options and systematically compare selected approaches. For example, many studies convert raw
  text into sentiment signals and use these as auxiliary inputs in a financial forecasting model. Concentrating on sentiment
  and, thereby, disregarding the actual content of the text, one may ask whether the sentiment extraction approach is suitable.
  In this context, we emphasize weak labeling, an NLP approach to finetune text classifiers on an unlabeled target corpus,
  which holds potential for financial forecasting but has received little attention in the corresponding literature. A second
  research goal concerns the well-known curse of dimensionality. Combining fundamental, technical, and text-based features in a
  forecasting model increases dimensionality substantially. This challenge is amplified in cryptocurrency forecasting in that
  yet another set of potentially relevant features can be extracted from the blockchain. We examine the predictive value of the
  different feature groups and benchmark alternative forecasting methods for high-dimensional time series data. In this context,
  we emphasize the temporal fusion transformer, which promises automatic feature selection, and assess its effectiveness vis-a-vis
  benchmark forecasting models. In sum, our study contributes original empirical evidence to the literature on cryptocurrency price
  forecasting. We also introduce several advanced deep learning methodologies for text processing and time series forecasting to the
  financial market modeling community, which are generally applicable in the field and can benefit financial forecasting at large. </p>"

  title: "The Live Streaming Recommendation and Mutual Fund Performance"
  description: "Authors: Qingfu Liu (Fudan University), Zhidan Luo (Fudan University), Yang Song (Washington University) and Chuanjie Wang (Fudan University)<br/>
  <p>Abstract:  The live streaming economy, particularly live streaming e-commerce, is becoming a major component of China's 
  digital economic development. This study investigates the impact of live streaming by fund companies on mutual fund performance,
  using data from over 10,000 live streams by 99 fund companies on China's leading fund live streaming platform, TianTian Fund APP.
  We employ machine learning techniques to process the live stream content and construct the 4Vs (Visual, Vocal, Verbal, and Visitor)
  to measure different aspects of the content. Our analysis reveals that participating in live streaming significantly increases
  investor attention and fund flow, but negatively affects performance. The 4Vs have heterogeneous effects on investor attention,
  fund flow, and performance. This research offers empirical evidence for the impact of live streaming on mutual fund performance
  and contributes to understanding the role of live streaming in the e-commerce industry.

  title: "Deep Switching State Space Model (DS3M) for Nonlinear Time Series Forecasting with Regime Switching"
  description: "Authors: Ying Chen, Xiuqin Xu <br/>
  <p>Abstract:  We propose a deep switching state space model (DSM) for efficient inference and forecasting of nonlinear time series with irregularly switching among various regimes. The switching among regimes is captured by both discrete and continuous latent variables with recurrent neural networks. The model is estimated with variational inference using a reparameterization trick. We test the approach on a variety of simulated and real datasets. In all cases, DSM achieves competitive performance compared to several state-of-the-art methods (e.g. GRU, SRNN, DSARF, SNLDS), with superior forecasting accuracy, convincing interpretability of the discrete latent variables, and powerful representation of the continuous latent variables for different kinds of time series. Specifically, the MAPE values increase by 0.09% to 15.71% against the second-best performing alternative models. </p>"

  title: "Statistics and Machine Learning in the fight against Modern Slavery"
  description: "Authors: Bernard Silverman<br/>
  <p>Abstract:  It is only in recent decades that the crime of Modern Slavery/Human Trafficking has become well established in the political and public consciousness.  I will discuss the part that statistical approaches have played and the actual and potential contribution of machine learning.   One important issue is the right way to deal with estimates that are known to be inaccurate but nevertheless may have beneficial impact.   There are some analogies with the public health achievements of Florence Nightingale in the 19th century, which saved many millions of lives even before the advent of modern scientific medicine.   </p>"

  title: "Tail Risk and Asset Prices in the Short-term"
  description: "Authors: Caio Almeida, Gustavo Freire, René Garcia and Rodrigo Hizmeri<br/>
  <p>Abstract:  We combine high-frequency stock returns with risk-neutralization to extract the daily common component of tail risks perceived by investors in the cross-section of firms. Our tail risk measure significantly predicts the equity premium and variance risk premium at short-horizons. Furthermore, a long-short portfolio built by sorting stocks on their recent exposure to tail risk generates abnormal returns with respect to standard factor models and helps explain the momentum anomaly. Incorporating investors' preferences via risk-neutralization is fundamental to our findings. </p>"

  title: "Deep Switching State Space Model (DS3M) for Nonlinear Time Series Forecasting with Regime Switching"
  description: "Authors: Ying Chen, Xiuqin Xu <br/>
  <p>Abstract:  We propose a deep switching state space model (DSM) for efficient inference and forecasting of nonlinear time series with irregularly switching among various regimes. The switching among regimes is captured by both discrete and continuous latent variables with recurrent neural networks. The model is estimated with variational inference using a reparameterization trick. We test the approach on a variety of simulated and real datasets. In all cases, DSM achieves competitive performance compared to several state-of-the-art methods (e.g. GRU, SRNN, DSARF, SNLDS), with superior forecasting accuracy, convincing interpretability of the discrete latent variables, and powerful representation of the continuous latent variables for different kinds of time series. Specifically, the MAPE values increase by 0.09% to 15.71% against the second-best performing alternative models. </p>"

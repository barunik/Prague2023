  title: "Statistics and Machine Learning in the fight against Modern Slavery"
  description: "Authors: Bernard Silverman<br/>
  <p>Abstract:  It is only in recent decades that the crime of Modern Slavery/Human Trafficking has become well established in the political and public consciousness.  I will discuss the part that statistical approaches have played and the actual and potential contribution of machine learning.   One important issue is the right way to deal with estimates that are known to be inaccurate but nevertheless may have beneficial impact.   There are some analogies with the public health achievements of Florence Nightingale in the 19th century, which saved many millions of lives even before the advent of modern scientific medicine.   </p>"

  title: "Finetuning NLP models for financial forecasting. Do or Don't? A Cryptocurrency Return Prediction Case Study"
  description: "Authors: Vincent Gurgul and Duygu Ider and Stefan Lessmann<br/>
  <p>Abstract:  Anticipating price developments in financial markets is a topic of continued interest in forecasting.
  Funneled by advancements in deep learning and natural language processing (NLP) together with the availability of
  vast amounts of textual data in form of news articles, social media postings, etc., an increasing number of studies
  incorporate text-based predictors in forecasting models. The hypothesis that text-based cues carry predictive information
  appears especially plausible for cryptocurrency markets, which are the subject of this study.  Noting some variation in how
  specifically prior work employs text features and advanced pre-trained NLP models for price modeling, the first research
  goal is to survey available options and systematically compare selected approaches. For example, many studies convert
  raw text into sentiment signals and use these as auxiliary inputs in a financial forecasting model. Concentrating on
  sentiment and, thereby, disregarding the actual content of the text, one may ask whether the sentiment extraction
  approach is suitable. In this context, we emphasize weak labeling, an NLP approach to finetune text classifiers on
  an unlabeled target corpus, which holds potential for financial forecasting but has received little attention in the corresponding literature.
  A second research goal concerns the well-known curse of dimensionality. Combining fundamental, technical, and
  text-based features in a forecasting model increases dimensionality substantially. This challenge is amplified in
  cryptocurrency forecasting in that yet another set of potentially relevant features can be extracted from the blockchain.
  We examine the predictive value of the different feature groups and benchmark alternative forecasting methods for
  high-dimensional time series data. In this context, we emphasize the temporal fusion transformer, which promises
  automatic feature selection, and assess its effectiveness vis-a-vis benchmark forecasting models. In sum, our
  study contributes original empirical evidence to the literature on cryptocurrency price forecasting. We also introduce
  several advanced deep learning methodologies for text processing and time series forecasting to the financial market modeling community, which are generally applicable in the field and can benefit financial forecasting at large. </p>"

  title: "Deep Switching State Space Model (DS3M) for Nonlinear Time Series Forecasting with Regime Switching"
  description: "Authors: Ying Chen, Xiuqin Xu <br/>
  <p>Abstract:  We propose a deep switching state space model (DSM) for efficient inference and forecasting of nonlinear time series with irregularly switching among various regimes. The switching among regimes is captured by both discrete and continuous latent variables with recurrent neural networks. The model is estimated with variational inference using a reparameterization trick. We test the approach on a variety of simulated and real datasets. In all cases, DSM achieves competitive performance compared to several state-of-the-art methods (e.g. GRU, SRNN, DSARF, SNLDS), with superior forecasting accuracy, convincing interpretability of the discrete latent variables, and powerful representation of the continuous latent variables for different kinds of time series. Specifically, the MAPE values increase by 0.09% to 15.71% against the second-best performing alternative models. </p>"
